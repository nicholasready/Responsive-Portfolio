 <p>Nicholas Ready (Aka Nick or Niko) is from Indianapolis, Indiana but has been living in Chicago for the past 7 years. He has midwestern roots but don't let that fool you into thinking he's "uncultured"-- he has lived in Saudi Arabia, China, and Mexico and travelled to countless other countries. </p>
<p>Nick graduated from Indiana University with a B.S. in Finance and minors in Mathematics and Chinese. With a love for numbers and languages, coding seemed to be the next natural step for Nick's career. When Nick isn't travelling or working, you can find him looking at cat videos on instagram, struggling to lift 20lb dumbbells at the gym, or eating at restaurants he simply can't afford.  </p>    
<p>One of Nick's absolute favorite past-times is to play his violin that was handcrafted in France in 1867. A famous composure by the name of Kirt Trevor acquired the violin while touring in France and brought it back to the United States knowing that someone was yearning to play a bold and sophisticated instrument like the one he set his eyes on. Although he doesn't play much anymore, he will usually say 'yes' to performing at friends' weddings.</p>
